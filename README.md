### Javascript dependencies

Use `npm install` to install all js packages.

### Python dependencies

Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all python packages. This is necessary since Heroku dosen't install all python packages with default commands. If you have to install a new python package, append it to requirements.txt file and re-run that install command. This should work.

You need all both dependencies installed to run locally the project.

Check you have installed `python` on your system. If you have `python3` installed and not python, spawn wouldn't found binaries to run python scripts.

Use `node index.js` or `npm run start` to run server.
